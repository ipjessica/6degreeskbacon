The Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon is a concept that explains how anyone in the Hollywood film industry can be connected to Kevin Bacon within six steps, where each step consists of finding a film in which two actors have starred. As such, I would like to find the shortest path between any two actors by choosing a sequence of movies that connects them. For example, the shortest path between Jennifer Lawrence and Tom Hanks is 2: Jennifer Lawrence is connected to Kevin Bacon by both starring in “X-Men: First Class,” and Kevin Bacon is connected to Tom Hanks by both starring in “Apollo 13.”

Search is one of the preliminary problems with regards to understanding the concept of artificial intelligence, insofar as a program's ability to search for a solution with information that is already given or that it already knows. In general, search problems comprise of an initial and goal state, and the objective is to use a search algorithm to get from the former to the latter. Those states and additional information such as path cost, action, and parent node are stored in nodes.
